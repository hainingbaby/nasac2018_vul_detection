/** @brief Loads an image from a file.

@anchor imread

The function imread loads an image from the specified file and returns it. If the image cannot be
read (because of missing file, improper permissions, unsupported or invalid format), the function
returns an empty matrix ( Mat::data==NULL ).

Currently, the following file formats are supported:

-   Windows bitmaps - \*.bmp, \*.dib (always supported)
-   JPEG files - \*.jpeg, \*.jpg, \*.jpe (see the *Notes* section)
-   JPEG 2000 files - \*.jp2 (see the *Notes* section)
-   Portable Network Graphics - \*.png (see the *Notes* section)
-   WebP - \*.webp (see the *Notes* section)
-   Portable image format - \*.pbm, \*.pgm, \*.ppm \*.pxm, \*.pnm (always supported)
-   Sun rasters - \*.sr, \*.ras (always supported)
-   TIFF files - \*.tiff, \*.tif (see the *Notes* section)
-   OpenEXR Image files - \*.exr (see the *Notes* section)
-   Radiance HDR - \*.hdr, \*.pic (always supported)
-   Raster and Vector geospatial data supported by Gdal (see the *Notes* section)

@note

-   The function determines the type of an image by the content, not by the file extension.
-   In the case of color images, the decoded images will have the channels stored in **B G R** order.
-   On Microsoft Windows\* OS and MacOSX\*, the codecs shipped with an OpenCV image (libjpeg,
    libpng, libtiff, and libjasper) are used by default. So, OpenCV can always read JPEGs, PNGs,
    and TIFFs. On MacOSX, there is also an option to use native MacOSX image readers. But beware
    that currently these native image loaders give images with different pixel values because of
    the color management embedded into MacOSX.
-   On Linux\*, BSD flavors and other Unix-like open-source operating systems, OpenCV looks for
    codecs supplied with an OS image. Install the relevant packages (do not forget the development
    files, for example, "libjpeg-dev", in Debian\* and Ubuntu\*) to get the codec support or turn
    on the OPENCV_BUILD_3RDPARTY_LIBS flag in CMake.
-   In the case you set *WITH_GDAL* flag to true in CMake and @ref IMREAD_LOAD_GDAL to load the image,
    then [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) driver will be used in order to decode the image by supporting
    the following formats: [Raster](http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html),
    [Vector](http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html).
-   If EXIF information are embedded in the image file, the EXIF orientation will be taken into account
    and thus the image will be rotated accordingly except if the flag @ref IMREAD_IGNORE_ORIENTATION is passed.
@param filename Name of file to be loaded.
@param flags Flag that can take values of cv::ImreadModes
